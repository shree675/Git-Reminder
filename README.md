## About
Git Reminder is a simple and useful VSCode extension that provides periodic reminders, along with their facilities, to save users from losing their work.

## Features

* Git Reminder activates on VSCode startup. If the present directory is recognized as a git-initialized directory, then the extension triggers a pull reminder immediately on startup.
* If the present directory is not git-initialized, then the extension will remain dormant.
